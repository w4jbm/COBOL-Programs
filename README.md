# COBOL-Programs

Hopefully this one stays fairly small...

> A COBOL programmer got rich doing Y2K work and decided to have himself cryogenically frozen when he died.\
> \
> One day many years from now he was unexpectedly resurrected.\
> \
> When he asked why he was unfrozen, they told him, "It's the year 9999--and you know COBOL!"
